					<p>Forward: Hero is an exciting new class introduced in EP5. Using Swords, Twin Machineguns, and Talises in an 
					exciting new and refreshing way, you too can be a <s>lazy ass</s> Hero!</p>
					<p>This guide is inspired by the many various other guides for PSO2 and this Girls' Frontline guide: <a href="https://gfl.matsuda.tips/" target="_blank">https://gfl.matsuda.tips/</a></p>

					<p>Your character looks like shit. If you're into this class because it's totally edgy and it fits your style, 
						read no more as this guide is not for you. If you're into this class because you can't imagine life without it,
						then please, keep reading. If you spot something that is incorrect, send a Pull Request. If you don't know what that is,

						<h3>Weapon Overview</h3>
						<p>
							The weapons used by Hero are Sword, Twin Machinegun, and Talis. However, with a twist on how they're
							used. Starting with Hero and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLcm8Gm5pyA" target="_blank">other newer classes in the future</a>,
							each will have a brand new animations and PAs to go long with them.						
						</p>
						<p>This section will cover and offer a brief explanation of the weapons of Hero.</p>

									<td>The bread n' butter I suppose. Nothing too fancy with it, except you'll be using it more often than not.
										Better get used to using it, cause the both of you awe going to UmU be bwest fwends for a vewwy wong time. OwO</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/tmg.png" alt="twin-machinegun icon" width="16px"></td>
									<td>Twin Machineguns</td>
									<td>Long range that isn't handled by what sword doesn't already cover. Popular weapon for those who <s>are bad at the game</s>
									just don't quite understand what is actually going on and never really hit more than 4 digit damage before.
									Great at generating gear and building up hits for Hero Time. Guzzles PP like a thirsty hooker, but the reload is

									<td>Duel Monsters is based upon a 5000-year-old game, it was played by Ancient Egyptians for power and was extremely dangerous.
									Great for the same reasons as Twin Machineguns, but unlike them, can actually deal damage. It's your move Kaiba.</td>

						<h3>Photon Arts</h3>
						<p>The Photon Arts for Hero are classified as Advanced-type PAs. This means they're in their own separate category in-game in-between the
						normal Photon Arts tab and the Techniques tab. This section will list the relevant PAs on their placement as a Hero.</p>
						<h4>Sword Photon Arts</h4>
						<table class="table table-responsive table-bordered">
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
									<th scope="col" style="width:150px">Photon Art</th>
									<th scope="col">Description</th>
								</tr>

							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/photon-arts/risingslash.png"></td>
									<td>Rising Slash</td>
									<td>Holding this PA down can make you really good at having people look down at you.
									The damage per slash isn't winning any favors. And had it been an anthropomorphic character,
									it could have been the star of its own show. Sadly, this isn't the genre for it, though its
									saving grace is that the sword throw and final slam deal more damage than the continous swing.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/photon-arts/brightnessend.png"></td>
									<td>Brightness End</td>
									<td>AoE 360 no-scope slash that gives Guard Frames. Can't say no to that.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/photon-arts/vaporbullet.png"></td>
									<td>Vapor Bullet</td>
									<td>One of the many boring PAs that you'll ever use. This single PA makes using Hero Twin Machineguns
									for anything else not reloading inadequate. You'll be using this on pretty much anything boss (or miniboss)
									related. You can move/cheese while using this PA. Also swaps to Twin Machineguns when long pressed.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td><img src="img/icons/photon-arts/flashtrick.png"></td>
									<td>Flash Trick</td>
									<td>A homing/travel PA. Can be used to quickly reach a locked on weak spot.
									Can also be used to quickly move about, at the cost of your PP. Long pressing will swap to your Talis.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td></td>
									<td>Sword Normals</td>
									<td>Not exactly a PA, but boy does it do as much as if you were using a PA.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td></td>
									<td>Aura (Sword Weapon Action)</td>
									<td>Not a PA either, but worth mentioning. Using your weapon action with sword lets you fire a stream of small bursts
										of photons. Can be used to regen PP. Combine with a macro to tap shift continously and you can be a lazy ass too!
										After unlocking and putting points into Aura High Charge on the tree, you can long press the weapon action to
										charge up and fire a massive blast of energy.</td>

						<h3>Skill Tree</h3>
						<p>The Skill Tree of a Hero is a very simple tree compared to the other classes in the game. Upon unlocking Hero,
						you are given the following Skills automatically:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Step JA Combo - Allows for a JA after you used Step.</li>
							<li>First Blood - Treats the first attack as a Just Attack, Techniques do not apply.</li>
							<li>Hero Mag - Converts your total attack values from your mag into Striking, Ranged and Technique.</li>
							<li>Step - Your basic dodge.</li>
							<li>Step Attack - Allows for an attack during Step.</li>
							<li>Just Reversal - Allows you to quickly recover after being knocked down.</li>
							<li>Next Jump - Allows you to double jump when using a Hero weapon.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Aside from these Skills, placing levels into Hero will give access to more Skill Points, thus allowing you
						to access more Skills on the Skill Tree.</p>
						
						<p>Core skills from the Hero tree are as followed. These are the skills you'll want to take as soon as possible. Prioritize them first!<p>
						<table class="table table-responsive table-bordered">
							<thead>
								<th scope="col">Skill Name</th>
								<th scope="col">Description</th>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>Hero Boost</td>
									<td>At level 10, this skill gives a 60% multiplier. (Assuming you don't get hit and 60 seconds have passed)</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Hero Counter</td>
									<td>Allows you to gain a power bonus to your Step Attack, when you Step dodge an attack.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Hero Weapon Bonus 1 & 2</td>
									<td>The real bullshit here. Gain a huge multiplier by just having a Hero weapon equipped.</td>
								</tr>

									<td>H. Attack Bonus</td>
									<td>Increases the power of your Normal Attacks. <b>NORMALS!!</b></td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Hero Gear / Hero Time</td>
									<td>Enables a gear gauge and a cool active (Hero Time) that can be activated when gear gauge is filled and boosts attack power
									based on the damage and number of hits done.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>HT Counter Bonus</td>
									<td>With this enabled, simply using Hero Counter will fill your gear gauge.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>HT Counter PP Gain</td>
									<td>With this enabled, as long as you don't get hit upon using Hero Time, you get all of your PP refilled. Pretty neat, isn't it?</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Hero Time Finish</td>
									<td>This skill allows for you to manually deactivate Hero Time for a kickass finisher. Finisher varies per Hero Weapon.<br>
										<ul>
											<li>Sword - Finisher involves a series of slashes in a zigzag fashion, with a final vertical slash.</li>
											<li>Twin Machinegun - Finisher is a powerful 360 AoE short ranged blast.</li>
											<li>Talis - Finisher is a concentrated orb of damage that lasts only for a brief moment.</li>
										</ul>

						<h3>MLG Strats</h3>
						<p>General idea is to alternate weapons to generate max gear. Once gear is maxed, you can choose to pop hero time and
						use Moment Trick twice to generate the maximum hits needed for Hero Time, and swap to Sword to ramp up the damage before gear gauge runs out and finishing with
						Hero Time Sword.</p>
